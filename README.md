## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

- Go (Golang) should be installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from [the official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Clone the Repository

You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YuriiCodes/go-cryptography-lab-1.git
```
### Install Go Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required Go dependencies. You can do this using the following command:

```bash
go get -u ./...

This command will download and install all the necessary dependencies for the project.
```
### Build the Project

After installing the dependencies, you can build the Cryptography Lab 1 project using the following command:

```bash
go build crypto-lab-1
```

This will compile the project, and you will find the executable file named `crypto-lab-1` in the project directory.

### Run the Project

To run the Cryptography Lab 1 application, use the following command:

```bash
./crypto-lab-1
```
